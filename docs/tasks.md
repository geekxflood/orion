# Orion Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Orion project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

### Module System
[ ] Implement proper module interfaces to standardize module development
[ ] Complete the implementation of the file_module.go which is currently empty
[ ] Complete the implementation of the http_module.go which is currently empty
[ ] Create a module registry system for dynamic module loading
[ ] Implement a module validation system to ensure modules meet the required interface

### Configuration Management
[ ] Refactor configuration handling to use a more robust approach (e.g., Viper)
[ ] Implement configuration validation to catch errors early
[ ] Add support for environment variable overrides for configuration values
[ ] Implement hot reloading of configuration with proper error handling
[ ] Add support for configuration templates

### Error Handling
[ ] Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the codebase
[ ] Add proper error logging with different severity levels
[ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms for critical components
[ ] Add context to errors for better debugging
[ ] Create custom error types for different categories of errors

## Code-Level Improvements

### Documentation
[ ] Add comprehensive godoc comments to all exported functions, types, and methods
[ ] Create architecture documentation explaining the system design
[ ] Document the module development process with examples
[ ] Create user guides for different use cases
[ ] Add inline comments for complex logic

### Testing
[ ] Increase test coverage across the codebase
[ ] Implement integration tests for the HTTP server
[ ] Add benchmark tests for performance-critical code
[ ] Implement property-based testing for complex functions
[ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Code Quality
[ ] Refactor the run.go file to reduce complexity and improve readability
[ ] Fix the inconsistency between Config.Modules (string) and the usage in run.go (checking for "file" or "http")
[ ] Implement proper logging throughout the application
[ ] Add context cancellation support for graceful shutdowns
[ ] Refactor the httpclient package to follow better separation of concerns

### Performance Optimizations
[ ] Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests
[ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
[ ] Optimize configuration refresh mechanism to reduce overhead
[ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
[ ] Profile the application to identify bottlenecks

### Security Enhancements
[ ] Implement proper authentication for API endpoints
[ ] Add HTTPS support with proper certificate handling
[ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs
[ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
[ ] Implement proper secrets management

## Feature Enhancements

### Monitoring and Observability
[ ] Add Prometheus metrics for self-monitoring
[ ] Implement structured logging for better log analysis
[ ] Add distributed tracing support
[ ] Create dashboards for monitoring the application
[ ] Implement health check endpoints with detailed status information

### User Experience
[ ] Create a web UI for configuration management
[ ] Implement a CLI tool for interacting with the API
[ ] Add support for configuration validation and linting
[ ] Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
[ ] Add interactive documentation (e.g., Swagger UI)

### Extensibility
[ ] Create a plugin system for custom extensions
[ ] Implement webhook support for event notifications
[ ] Add support for custom data transformations
[ ] Create an SDK for developing custom modules
[ ] Implement a scripting interface for custom logic

## DevOps and Infrastructure

### Deployment
[ ] Create Kubernetes manifests for deployment
[ ] Implement a Helm chart for easier deployment
[ ] Add support for container orchestration platforms
[ ] Create deployment documentation for different environments
[ ] Implement infrastructure as code for the project

### CI/CD
[ ] Set up automated builds and tests
[ ] Implement semantic versioning
[ ] Create release automation
[ ] Add static code analysis to the CI pipeline
[ ] Implement automated dependency updates

### Documentation Infrastructure
[ ] Set up automated documentation generation
[ ] Create a documentation website
[ ] Implement versioned documentation
[ ] Add search functionality to documentation
[ ] Create interactive examples in documentation
